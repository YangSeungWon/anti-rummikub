# Anti-Rummikub: Improv Showdown - Test Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the testing strategy and implementation for the "Anti-Rummikub: Improv Showdown" project, a real-time multiplayer game. The testing approach covers multiple levels from unit tests to end-to-end tests, ensuring the application's reliability and stability.

## Testing Strategy

The project implements a multi-layered testing approach:

### 1. Frontend Unit Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)

- **API Client Tests**: Authentication flows, game API operations
- **Component Tests**: UI rendering, state management, user interactions
- **Custom Hook Tests**: Socket connection, event handling, game state management

### 2. Backend Unit Tests (Jest)

- **Utility Functions**: Score calculation, game logic validation
- **Model Validation**: Data structure integrity, constraints

### 3. Backend Integration Tests

- **Game Flow**: End-to-end API flow covering user journey
- **Error Handling**: Authentication, validation, edge cases

### 4. End-to-End Tests (Cypress)

- **Full Game Flow**: User signup, game creation, gameplay, voting, results
- **Edge Cases**: Error handling, reconnection scenarios

## Test Implementation

| Components | `LoginForm.test.tsx`<br>`Timer.test.tsx`<br>`VoteBar.test.tsx` | ~85%     | Rendering, user interaction, state updates, validation   |
| Hooks      | `useSocket.test.tsx`<br>`useGameSocket.test.tsx`               | ~80%     | Socket connection, event handling, state synchronization |

### Backend Tests

| Category    | Test Files                | Coverage | Key Areas Tested                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |

| Integration | `gameFlow.test.js`        | ~70%     | Complete game flow from creation to completion  |

### Backend Test Details

#### Unit Testing

- **Score Calculator Tests**:

  - Testing different voting scenarios (all positive, mixed, all negative)
  - Handling edge cases (no votes, high difficulty)
  - Verifying score calculation formulas with different difficulties
  - Boundary testing (minimum/maximum scores)

- **Model Validation Tests**:
  - User model: Username/password validation
  - Game model: Player limits, status transitions
  - Round model: Vote validation, state machine transitions

#### Integration Testing

- **Game Flow Integration** (`gameFlow.test.js`):

  - User creation and authentication
  - Game creation by first user
  - Additional players joining the game
  - Ready status management
  - Game initialization
  - Round progression
  - Vote submission and tallying
  - Score calculation
  - Game completion

- **API Security Testing**:

  - Authentication middleware validation
  - Permission checks (game creator vs participants)
  - Input validation and error response formatting

- **Database Integration**:
  - Document creation/retrieval/update testing
  - Reference integrity between models (User -> Game -> Round)

#### Backend Test Implementation Techniques

- **Test Database**: Dedicated MongoDB test instance with isolated data
- **Test Fixtures**: Pre-populated test data for consistent test execution
- **Before/After Hooks**: Database setup and cleanup between test runs
- **HTTP Request Simulation**: Using Supertest to validate API endpoints
- **JWT Authentication**: Testing token generation and validation
- **Mocked Socket Events**: Simulating real-time communication

### End-to-End Tests

| Test File         | Key Scenarios                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fullGame.cy.ts`  | User registration, game creation, joining, gameplay    |
| `game-flow.cy.ts` | Game initialization, round progression, error handling |

## Test Configuration

### Frontend Test Setup

- **Jest Configuration**: Custom setup to handle React 19, CSS modules, environment variables
- **Mock Implementation**:
  - API responses (`api/index.ts`)
  - Socket.io connections (`setupTests.ts`)
  - Local storage for auth persistence

### Backend Test Setup

- **Test Database**: Dedicated MongoDB instance for testing
- **Fixtures**: Pre-populated users, games, topics for consistent testing
- **Request Mocking**: Supertest for API endpoint testing
- **Environment Configuration**: Separate .env.test configuration
- **Test Timeout Extensions**: Increased timeouts for async operations
- **Error Logging**: Enhanced error capture during test execution
